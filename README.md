# REST API Boilerplate

A modular, production-ready **Node.js + Express + MongoDB** backend starter, designed for rapid development of authenticated REST APIs.

This boilerplate includes user management, JWT-based authentication, role-based access, email verification, password reset, and file uploads via Cloudinary.


## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** + **Express**
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose**
- **JWT** for authentication
- **SendGrid** for transactional emails
- **Cloudinary** for file uploads
- **Multer** for handling file input
- **Swagger (OpenAPI)** for live API docs


## ✅ Features

- User signup, login, logout
- Email verification on registration
- Password reset with token-based flow
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Cloudinary-based image upload
- Soft deletion of users
- Feedback module (create, read, update, delete)
- Fully documented via Swagger at `/docs`
